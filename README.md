The best way to simulate a Science Bowl round on Discord.

## About
scibowlbot (styled in lowercase) is a Discord bot created by the team at [DevNotHackerCorporations](https://github.com/DevNotHackerCorporations) originally meant as a better version of [Womogenes's ScibowlBot](https://github.com/womogenes/ScibowlBot) by incorporating more "modern" discord features like buttons and select menus. These days, scibowlbot has evolved into a complex bot with complex commands. Also, if you're wondering, scibowlbot was created on the 2nd of December, 2021 at 4:00PM (PST). scibowlbot runs on v2.0 [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and the [Flask framework](https://github.com/pallets/flask).
